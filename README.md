# kind-cilium-mesh

A [Cilium cluster mesh](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.7/gettingstarted/clustermesh/) between two [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) clusters for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

* `git`
* [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

## Introduction

This project bootstraps a [cluster mesh](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.7/gettingstarted/clustermesh/) between two [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) clusters using [Cilium](https://cilium.io) which can be used for demo or testing purposes.

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap the cluster mesh, run

```shell
$ ./kind-cilium-mesh-up.sh
```

This will...

* ... create two kind clusters with one control-plane node and two worker nodes;
* ... install Cilium as the CNI plugin;
* ... expose each cluster's Cilium-managed etcd cluster using a service of type `NodePort`;
* ... configure the cluster mesh using https://github.com/cilium/clustermesh-tools.
* ... deploy an example HTTP application and configure it to be [load-balanced across both clusters](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.7/gettingstarted/clustermesh/#load-balancing-with-global-services).

It may take some time for the cluster mesh to be fully operational.
To inspect the status of Cilium and the cluster mesh during or after the process, you may run

```shell
$ for context in kind-kind-cilium-mesh-1 kind-kind-cilium-mesh-2; do                                                                                      
    for pod in $(kubectl --context ${context} -n kube-system get pod -l k8s-app=cilium -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
      kubectl --context ${context} -n kube-system exec ${pod} -- cilium status;
    done
  done
```

When the cluster mesh is fully operational, you should see six of these lines in the output of the above command:

```
Cluster health:   6/6 reachable   (2020-03-21T10:54:51Z)
```

## Testing

To test the cluster mesh and cross-cluster load-balancing, you can run the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl run -i --image giantswarm/tiny-tools --restart Never --rm -t tiny-tools -- /bin/sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://cluster-info/; done'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-j6lw8'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-2/cluster-info-5688f75d47-s7fql'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-flblg'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-j6lw8'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-2/cluster-info-5688f75d47-s7fql'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-j6lw8'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-2/cluster-info-5688f75d47-7q4cp'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-2/cluster-info-5688f75d47-7q4cp'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-flblg'
Hello from 'kind-cilium-mesh-1/cluster-info-578986d664-j6lw8'
```

You'll be able to observe responses from both clusters (`kind-cilium-mesh-1` and `kind-cilium-mesh-2`) and from two pods from each of these clusters.

## Tearing down

To tear down the kind clusters, run

```shell
$ kind delete cluster --name kind-cilium-mesh-1
$ kind delete cluster --name kind-cilium-mesh-2
```
